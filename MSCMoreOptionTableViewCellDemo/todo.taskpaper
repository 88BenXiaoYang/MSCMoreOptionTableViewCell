TODO:
	- Cache located views on the ViewLocator, so they aren't looked up everytime we ask for one.
		[viewLocator locateViews] to cache all of them?
		or lazy caching, but reset when locateViews is called?
		or notify of subviews did change so it can invalidate the cache?

	- Automated tests for delegate methods not used in the example
		titleColorForDeleteConfirmationButtonForRowAtIndexPath
		backgroundColorForDeleteConfirmationButtonForRowAtIndexPath
